# Aletheion – Cognitive Incubator

This repository contains the public declaration and high-level documentation
of Aletheion, a non-agentic cognitive incubation framework.

Aletheion is not an AI model, not an agent, and not a product.
It does not simulate consciousness, agency, or autonomous decision-making.

---

## What Aletheion Is

Aletheion defines a conceptual space where cognitive configurations
can be examined for:

- internal coherence
- structural stability
- semantic integrity

The focus is not on producing answers or decisions,
but on exposing internal tensions and inconsistencies
within a cognitive structure.

No optimization goals are used.
No reward mechanisms are present.
No autonomous behavior is implemented.

---

## What Aletheion Is Not

Aletheion is explicitly NOT:

- an AGI project
- a conscious system
- an AI agent
- a chatbot
- a decision-making engine
- a commercial product
- a startup or roadmap

Any interpretation beyond these boundaries is incorrect.

## Core Principles (Summary)

- Internal coherence takes precedence over output quality
- Cognitive structure is separated from narrative or persona
- Incubation replaces training
- Reduction of internal tension is preferred over solution generation
- Clarity is valued over performance

(See CORE_PRINCIPLES.md for the full list.)
