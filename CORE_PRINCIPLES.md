# Core Principles

1. Internal coherence takes precedence over output quality.
2. No goal functions or reward mechanisms are used.
3. No autonomous decision-making is implemented.
4. Cognitive structure is explicitly separated from narrative or persona.
5. Incubation replaces training as the primary mode of operation.
6. Reduction of internal tension is preferred over solution generation.
