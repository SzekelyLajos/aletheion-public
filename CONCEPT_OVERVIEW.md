# Aletheion – Concept Overview

Aletheion is a non-agentic cognitive incubation framework.

It is not an AI model.
It is not a product.
It does not simulate consciousness, agency, or autonomous decision-making.

The purpose of Aletheion is to provide a structured space
where cognitive configurations can be examined for internal coherence,
semantic stability, and structural tension.

The framework prioritizes clarity over performance
and understanding over optimization.
